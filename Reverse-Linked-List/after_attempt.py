After trial and error, I've finally understood the concept of linked lists,
The links between the nodes are important, that's why we're playing / manipulating
the '2' variables prev, current, and the method .next carefully.
Using a drawing is very beneficial to understand the problem.


Time complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), because we reversed the linked list in a single pass, where ùëõ n is the number of nodes in a linked list.

Space complexity:

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), because no extra memory is used.
